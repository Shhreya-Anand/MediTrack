**MediTrack - RFID-Based Patient Medication Tracking System**

MediTrack is an innovative healthcare solution that utilizes RFID technology to track patient medication adherence. By integrating RFID tags and a notification system, MediTrack ensures that patients take their medication on time. In case of missed or delayed doses, the system sends notifications via email or push notifications, allowing healthcare providers and patients to stay on top of their medication schedules.

**Project Overview**

MediTrack leverages RFID technology and integrates it with an email and push notification system to monitor whether patients are taking their medications on time. If a patient takes their medication at the wrong time or misses it, the system sends a notification, ensuring timely medication adherence.

**Features**

RFID-Based Tracking: Each patient is issued an RFID tag that they tap to confirm theyâ€™ve taken their medication.
Automated Notifications: If a patient misses or delays their medication, the system sends a notification via email or push notification.
Data Logging: Logs each medication event, including the time prescribed and the time the medication was actually taken.
Admin Dashboard: Healthcare providers can monitor patients' medication adherence and view detailed logs.
Scalability: Easily expandable to other healthcare domains such as patient check-in/check-out, equipment tracking, etc.
Hardware and Software Requirements

**Hardware**
Raspberry Pi (any version with internet connectivity)
RFID Reader Module (e.g., RC522)
RFID Tags for patient identification
jumper wires, and connectors
Software
Raspberry Pi OS (latest version)
Python 3.x
Email SMTP server (e.g., Gmail SMTP)
Node Js and Java script 
MongoDB for data logging and storing medication schedules
System Architecture

RFID Reader: The patient taps their RFID tag, and the system logs the time.
Backend Logic: The system checks if the medication was taken at the prescribed time.
Database (MongoDB): Stores patient data, medication schedules, and timestamps.
Notification System: Sends notifications via email (using SMTP) and/or push notifications (via Firebase Cloud Messaging) if the medication schedule is missed or delayed.
Reports: Weekly reports generated by AI to monitor progress
